# zkml-credit-audit
This project introduces a privacy-preserving framework to audit AI credit scoring models using Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning and decentralized governance, ensuring fairness without exposing sensitive data or model internals. It offers scalable, ethical oversight for financial AI systems.

## Features
- Fairness-aware credit scoring
- ZKML circuit generation
- DAO-based audit simulation
- Soulbound token reputation system

## Dataset
Loan Approval Classification Dataset from GTS.ai

## Tech Stack
Python, scikit-learn, EZKL, Solidity, Pandas, Jupyter

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. Run notebooks in `/notebooks` to explore and train models
